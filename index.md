We present the design and implementation of a taskable reactive mobile manipulation system. Contrary to related work, we treat the arm and base degrees of freedom as a holistic structure which greatly improves the speed and fluidity of the resulting motion. At the core of this approach is a robust and reactive motion controller which can achieve a desired end-effector pose while avoiding joint position and velocity limits, and ensuring the mobile manipulator is manoeuvrable throughout the trajectory. This can support sensor-based behaviours such as closed-loop visual grasping. As no planning is involved in our approach, the robot is never stationary _thinking_ about what to do next. We show the versatility of our holistic motion controller by implementing a pick and place system using behaviour trees and demonstrate this task on a 9-degree-of-freedom mobile manipulator. Additionally, we provide an open-source implementation of our motion controller for both non-holonomic and omnidirectional mobile manipulators.

This approach can be used on both holonomic and omnidirectional mobile manipualtors. In the video below, we show it working on a 9 degree-of-freedom mobile manipualtor.

## How do I use it?

We have a created a robotics Python library called [Robotics Toolbox for Python](https://github.com/petercorke/robotics-toolbox-python) which allows our algorithm to be used an any robot. The following examples uses our [Swift](https://github.com/jhavl/swift) simulator.

Install [Robotics Toolbox for Python](https://github.com/petercorke/robotics-toolbox-python) and [Swift](https://github.com/jhavl/swift) using

```shell
pip3 install roboticstoolbox-python
```
